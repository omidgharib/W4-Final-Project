### Pull requests  

Good pull requests — patches, improvements, new features — are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

If your contribution involves a significant amount of work or substantial
changes to any part of the project, please open an issue to discuss it first.

Please follow this process; it's the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project.

2. Clone your fork (`git clone
   https://github.com/omidgharib/W4-Final-Project.git`).

3. Add an `upstream` remote (`git remote add upstream
   https://github.com/omidgharib/W4-Final-Project.git`).

4. Get the latest changes from upstream (e.g. `git pull upstream
   <dev-branch>`).

5. Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix (`git
   checkout -b <topic-branch-name>`).

6. Make sure that your changes adhere to the current coding conventions used
   throughout the project - indentation, accurate comments, etc. Please update
   any documentation that is relevant to the change you are making.

7. Commit your changes in logical chunks; use git's [interactive
   rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase) feature to tidy
   up your commits before making them public. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message
   guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your pull request is unlikely be merged into the main project.

8. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream branch into your topic branch.

9. Push your topic branch up to your fork (`git push origin
   <topic-branch-name>`).

10. [Open a Pull Request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) with a
    clear title and description. Please mention which browsers you tested in.
